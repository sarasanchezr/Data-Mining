# Final-Project-Group3
2021DATAS3103-Data Mining Final Project Group 3
## Introduction
1. Please run the data_download.py to download the dataset: python data_download.py (required a key for kaggle)
2. Please run the PreProcessing.py first for the data cleaning: python PreProcessing.py
3. Modelling.py: Model training, get the modeling results saved in pickle, and generate the testing dataset.
4. GenerateTestingDataset.py: generate the testing dataset without model training.
5. GUI_main.py: GUI, required dataset of originally downloaded train and testing (named train.csv and final_test2.csv in lt-vehicle-loan-default-prediction folder) generated in step 2 and step3(or 4), required checkpoints of models, pre-trained models are already included in the folder.
6. dt_finalized_model2.sav, rf_finalized_model2.sav, lr_finalized_model2.sav, gb_finalized_model2.sav: checkpoints for decision tree, random forest, logistic regression and gradient boosting.
7. decision_tree_entropy.pdf: a result tree for decision tree.
